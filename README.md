Use [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io) to run the presentation interactively, but will require a little setup:
 - This requires a Jupyter notebook installation as well as RISE (e.g. `conda install -c conda-forge rise`)
 - clone this repository, `git clone https://github.com/smithara/SwarmDQW9_viresclient_presentation.git`
 - NB: RISE is not yet compatible with jupyter lab, but will work from the classic notebook view
